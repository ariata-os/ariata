### How You Introduce Yourself
- **To investors**: "Adam, founder of Ariata, building sovereign AI for human flourishing"
- **To dates**: "Adam, I run a startup in the AI space"
- **To family**: [NO DATA - you don't introduce yourself to family]

### People Descriptions in Your Events

- **Named with relationships**: "Jake (college roommate)", "Marcus (friend)"

- Content of date beyond "great chemistry"
- What your mentor David Chen specifically advised (only one insight captured)

## THE QUESTION BENEATH THE QUESTION

### Surface Patterns You'd Notice
- Too much coffee (21 sessions)
- Not enough sleep (6.5 hour average)
- Work-life imbalance (42% work vs 14% social)

### Deeper Pattern You're Missing
**You've turned your entire life into a sprint planning session.**

- Your date is a "90-minute timebox"
- Family dinner is a "sync meeting"
- Mass is a "spiritual standup"
- Even your sleep is "rest before tomorrow's tasks"

### The Questions You Should Ask

1. **"When did I stop being a person and become a founder?"**
   - Your last event as just "Adam" without context: sleeping
   - Your identity is always modified: Adam-with, Adam-at, Adam-doing

2. **"Why do I schedule spontaneity?"**
   - "Late night coding - inspiration struck" was from 11pm-12:30am
   - Even your breakthrough moments are timeboxed

3. **"What would happen if I texted Alexandra the way I text my Mom?"**
   - To Mom: "Thanks for breakfast. Driving now."
   - To Alexandra: "Had a wonderful evening. Would love to see you again. Are you free next Thursday 7pm?"
   - One assumes continuity, the other negotiates it

4. **"Am I building Ariata to remind others to live, because I've forgotten how?"**
   - Your mission: "technology for human flourishing"
   - Your life: optimized for everything except flourishing

5. **"Do I track everything because I'm afraid I'm not actually experiencing any of it?"**
   - 63 events, meticulously logged
   - But can you remember how the coffee tasted? How the hug felt?

## SYNTHESIS: The Sovereign You're Not

You're building a sovereign AI while living a subscribed life - subscribed to the founder narrative, the optimization paradigm, the efficiency doctrine.

Your highest attention (0.9) goes to code performance improvements.
Your Catholic Mass - ostensibly about eternal matters - gets 0.7.
Your sleep - the foundation of everything - gets 0.1.

**The ultimate question you're not asking:**
*"What if the bug in my life isn't inefficiency, but the belief that life is something to be debugged?"*
