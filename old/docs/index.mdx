**Experimental Phase**: Expect rapid iteration and sweeping changes as we refine the core applications and infrastructure.

## What is Ariata

Ariata is your personal AI agent that ingests your digital life—from calendar events and locations to health metrics and screen time—constructing a coherent, queryable timeline. Unlike cloud services that monetize your data, Ariata runs on your infrastructure, ensuring complete privacy and control.

Your data is incredibly valuable—companies build trillion-dollar empires on it. Ariata lets you reclaim that value for yourself:

- **Train personal AI on YOUR data**, not theirs
- **Life logging and memory augmentation** for perfect recall
- **Health and productivity optimization** through pattern recognition  
- **Build a queryable life archive** of your entire digital existence
- **Generate insights for self-improvement** from your actual behavior
- **See what data companies collect** and take back control

## Quick Start

Get Ariata running in under 2 minutes:

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone and setup">
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ariata-os/ariata
cd ariata

# Start the entire stack
make dev
```
</Step>

<Step title="Access the dashboard">
```bash
# Open the dashboard
open http://localhost:3000
```
</Step>

<Step title="Configure data sources">
Navigate to Settings → Sources in the web UI to connect your data sources.
</Step>
</Steps>

The system will automatically:
- Initialize PostgreSQL with PostGIS and pgvector extensions
- Set up MinIO for object storage
- Start Redis for task queuing
- Launch the SvelteKit web application
- Spin up Celery workers for background processing

## Your Data, Your Database

Unlike cloud services that lock away your data, Ariata gives you **direct PostgreSQL access**. Query your life with SQL, build custom analytics, or export everything—it's your database.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import psycopg2
import pandas as pd

conn = psycopg2.connect(
    "postgresql://readonly_user:secure_pass@your-server:5432/ariata"
)

# Query your heart rate during meetings
df = pd.read_sql("""
    SELECT h.timestamp, h.heart_rate as bpm, c.summary as meeting
    FROM stream_ios_healthkit h
    JOIN stream_google_calendar c 
        ON h.timestamp BETWEEN c.start_time AND c.end_time
    WHERE h.heart_rate IS NOT NULL
""", conn)
```

```javascript JavaScript
import { Client } from 'pg';

const client = new Client({
  connectionString: 'postgresql://readonly_user:secure_pass@your-server:5432/ariata'
});

await client.connect();
const result = await client.query(`
  SELECT * FROM stream_google_calendar 
  WHERE start_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
`);
```

```sql SQL
-- Daily step summary
SELECT 
  DATE(timestamp) as day,
  SUM(steps) as total_steps,
  AVG(heart_rate) as avg_heart_rate
FROM stream_ios_healthkit
GROUP BY DATE(timestamp)
ORDER BY day DESC
LIMIT 30;
```
</CodeGroup>

**Manage credentials** at `/settings/database` in your Ariata UI—create read-only users for analysis or full access for integrations. Works with any PostgreSQL client: TablePlus, DBeaver, Jupyter notebooks, or your favorite BI tool.

## Self-Hosting & Networking

### Recommended: Tailscale Setup (5 Minutes)

Tailscale creates a secure, private network between your devices. Your Ariata instance stays completely private while remaining accessible from all your devices.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Tailscale on your server">
```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscale up
```
</Step>

<Step title="Note your Tailscale IP">
After login, note your IP (e.g., `100.64.1.5`)
</Step>

<Step title="Install Tailscale on your devices">
- **iOS**: App Store → Tailscale
- **macOS**: `brew install --cask tailscale`
- **Windows/Linux**: [tailscale.com/download](https://tailscale.com/download)
</Step>

<Step title="Update your configuration">
```bash
# Update your .env file:
PUBLIC_IP=100.64.1.5  # Your Tailscale IP
FRONTEND_URL=http://100.64.1.5:3000

# Restart Ariata:
make restart
```
</Step>

<Step title="Access from any device">
```bash
open http://100.64.1.5:3000
# Or use MagicDNS: http://your-machine.tail-scale.ts.net:3000
```
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Why Tailscale?**
- Zero exposed ports - servers aren't on the public internet
- E2E encrypted WireGuard protocol  
- Works behind firewalls, NAT, cellular networks
- Free tier includes 100 devices and 3 users
</Note>

## Architecture

Ariata follows a stream-based ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) architecture:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Sources] -->|Extract| B[Raw Storage]
    B -->|Load| C[PostgreSQL]
    C -->|Transform| D[Timeline]
    
    A2[Google Calendar] --> A
    A3[iOS HealthKit] --> A
    A4[Mac Applications] --> A
    
    B --> B1[MinIO Objects]
    B --> B2[Time-series Data]
    
    D --> D1[Queryable History]
    D --> D2[AI Insights]
```

### Database Schema

The schema follows an ELT pipeline pattern:

- `source_configs`: Global catalog of source types
- `sources`: Active source instances (e.g., "My iPhone")
- `stream_configs`: Global catalog of stream types  
- `streams`: Active stream instances with settings
- `stream_*`: Time-series data tables (e.g., `stream_google_calendar`)
