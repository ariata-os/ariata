## What is Ariata

Ariata is your personal AI agent that ingests your digital life‚Äîfrom calendar events and locations to health metrics and screen time‚Äîconstructing a coherent, queryable timeline. Unlike cloud services that monetize your data, Ariata runs on your infrastructure, ensuring complete privacy and control.

<https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d3b0c3b-f20b-4b74-b250-c5ff4c3d8d3d>

Your data is incredibly valuable‚Äîcompanies build trillion-dollar empires on it. Ariata lets you reclaim that value for yourself:

- **Train personal AI on YOUR data**, not theirs
- **Life logging and memory augmentation** for perfect recall
- **Health and productivity optimization** through pattern recognition  
- **Build a queryable life archive** of your entire digital existence
- **Generate insights for self-improvement** from your actual behavior
- **See what data companies collect** and take back control

## Your Data, Your Database

Unlike cloud services that lock away your data, Ariata gives you **direct PostgreSQL access**. Query your life with SQL, build custom analytics, or export everything‚Äîit's your database.

```python
# Connect directly to YOUR data
import psycopg2
import pandas as pd

conn = psycopg2.connect(
    "postgresql://readonly_user:secure_pass@your-server:5432/ariata"
)

# Query your heart rate during meetings
df = pd.read_sql("""
    SELECT h.timestamp, h.heart_rate as bpm, c.summary as meeting
    FROM stream_ios_healthkit h
    JOIN stream_google_calendar c 
        ON h.timestamp BETWEEN c.start_time AND c.end_time
    WHERE h.heart_rate IS NOT NULL
""", conn)
```

**Manage credentials** at `/settings/database` in your Ariata UI‚Äîcreate read-only users for analysis or full access for integrations. Works with any PostgreSQL client: TablePlus, DBeaver, Jupyter notebooks, or your favorite BI tool.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Get Ariata running in under 2 minutes:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ariata-os/ariata
cd ariata

# Start the entire stack (PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, Web App, Workers)
# make dev automatically clones .env.example as .env if none available
make dev

# Open the dashboard
open http://localhost:3000

```

That's it! The system will:

- Initialize PostgreSQL with PostGIS and pgvector extensions
- Set up MinIO for object storage
- Start Redis for task queuing
- Launch the SvelteKit web application
- Spin up Celery workers for background processing

## üåê Self-Hosting & Networking

### Recommended: Tailscale Setup (5 Minutes)

Tailscale creates a secure, private network between your devices. Your Ariata instance stays completely private while remaining accessible from all your devices.

#### Quick Start with Tailscale

```bash
# 1. Install Tailscale on your server (where Docker is running)
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscale up

# 2. Note your Tailscale IP (shown after login, e.g., 100.64.1.5)

# 3. Install Tailscale app on your devices:
# - iOS: App Store ‚Üí Tailscale
# - macOS: brew install --cask tailscale
# - Windows/Linux: https://tailscale.com/download

# 4. Update your .env file:
PUBLIC_IP=100.64.1.5  # Your Tailscale IP from step 2
FRONTEND_URL=http://100.64.1.5:3000

# 5. Restart Ariata:
make restart

# 6. Access from any device on your Tailscale network:
open http://100.64.1.5:3000
# Or use MagicDNS: http://your-machine.tail-scale.ts.net:3000
```

**Why Tailscale?**

Zero exposed port -- servers aren't on the public internet. E2EE WireGuard protocol. Behind firewalls, NAT, cellular networks. 100 devices, 3 users, perfect for personal use.

### Direct Database Access

Once on Tailscale, you can connect directly to your PostgreSQL database:

```python
# Python
import psycopg2
import pandas as pd

conn = psycopg2.connect(
    "postgresql://ariata_user:ariata_password@100.64.1.5:5432/ariata"
)
df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM stream_ios_healthkit WHERE heart_rate IS NOT NULL", conn)
```

```javascript
// JavaScript/TypeScript
import { Client } from 'pg';

const client = new Client({
  connectionString: 'postgresql://ariata_user:ariata_password@100.64.1.5:5432/ariata'
});
await client.connect();
const result = await client.query('SELECT * FROM stream_google_calendar');
```

See the [Database Access](#database-access) section for managing read-only users and connection strings.

### Alternative Networking Options

**Local Only (Simplest):**

```bash
# No changes needed, access at:
http://localhost:3000
```

**Public VPS (Advanced):**

- Use the included `deploy-ec2-setup.sh` script
- Add HTTPS with Caddy or Traefik
- Consider authentication layer (Authelia)

### How External Services Work

Even with Tailscale, these features work perfectly:

- **OAuth (Google/Notion)**: Handled by `auth.ariata.com` proxy
- **API Syncing**: Outbound connections work normally
- **AI Features**: Can call OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
- **Calendar/Email**: Fetches data via polling

Your instance makes outbound connections but accepts no inbound traffic from the internet.

## üì¶ Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose (v2.0+)
- 8GB RAM minimum, 16GB recommended
- 20GB free disk space

## üîê Database Access

Ariata provides direct PostgreSQL access for power users. Connect with any SQL client, Jupyter notebooks, or your favorite programming language.

### Managing Database Users

Navigate to `/settings/database` in your Ariata web UI to:

- Create read-only users for safe data analysis
- Create read-write users for custom integrations  
- Generate secure connection strings

### Example Queries

```sql
-- Recent heart rate data
SELECT timestamp, heart_rate 
FROM stream_ios_healthkit 
WHERE heart_rate IS NOT NULL 
AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Location history
SELECT timestamp, longitude as lon, latitude as lat
FROM stream_ios_location 
WHERE timestamp::date = CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY timestamp;

-- Daily step summary
SELECT 
  DATE(timestamp) as day,
  SUM(steps) as total_steps,
  AVG(heart_rate) as avg_heart_rate
FROM stream_ios_healthkit
GROUP BY DATE(timestamp)
ORDER BY day DESC;
```

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Details

### ELT Data Pipeline

Ariata uses an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) architecture to preserve raw data while enabling flexible analysis:

1. **Extract**: Pull raw data from APIs and devices
2. **Load**: Store in MinIO and PostgreSQL with full fidelity
3. **Transform**: Process and aggregate data for analysis

This approach ensures you never lose data and can reprocess with improved algorithms later.

### Processing Modes

- **Real-time**: Continuous processing for immediate insights
- **Batch**: Nightly consolidation for pattern discovery
- **On-demand**: Query-time transformations for flexibility

### Tech Stack

**Backend**: Python, Celery, FastAPI, PostgreSQL (PostGIS/pgvector), Redis, MinIO  
**Frontend**: SvelteKit, TypeScript, TailwindCSS  
**Mobile**: Swift/SwiftUI (iOS/macOS)  
**ML/AI**: PELT change detection, HDBSCAN clustering, Vector embeddings
