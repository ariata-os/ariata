## What is Ariata

Ariata is your personal AI agent that ingests your digital life‚Äîfrom calendar events and locations to health metrics and screen time‚Äîconstructing a coherent, queryable timeline. Unlike cloud services that monetize your data, Ariata runs on your infrastructure, ensuring complete privacy and control.

<https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d3b0c3b-f20b-4b74-b250-c5ff4c3d8d3d>

Your data is incredibly valuable‚Äîcompanies build trillion-dollar empires on it. Ariata lets you reclaim that value for yourself:

- **Train personal AI on YOUR data**, not theirs
- **Life logging and memory augmentation** for perfect recall
- **Health and productivity optimization** through pattern recognition
- **Build a queryable life archive** of your entire digital existence
- **Generate insights for self-improvement** from your actual behavior
- **See what data companies collect** and take back control

## Your Data, Your Database

Unlike cloud services that lock away your data, Ariata gives you **direct PostgreSQL access**. Query your life with SQL, build custom analytics, or export everything‚Äîit's your database.

```python
# Connect directly to YOUR data
import psycopg2
import pandas as pd

conn = psycopg2.connect(
    "postgresql://readonly_user:secure_pass@your-server:5432/ariata"
)

# Query your heart rate during meetings
df = pd.read_sql("""
    SELECT h.timestamp, h.heart_rate as bpm, c.summary as meeting
    FROM stream_ios_healthkit h
    JOIN stream_google_calendar c
        ON h.timestamp BETWEEN c.start_time AND c.end_time
    WHERE h.heart_rate IS NOT NULL
""", conn)
```

**Manage credentials** at `/settings/database` in your Ariata UI‚Äîcreate read-only users for analysis or full access for integrations. Works with any PostgreSQL client: TablePlus, DBeaver, Jupyter notebooks, or your favorite BI tool.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Get Ariata running in under 2 minutes:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ariata-os/ariata
cd ariata

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Start all services
docker compose up -d

# Wait for services to initialize (30 seconds)
sleep 30

# Check everything is running
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Open the web interface
open http://localhost:3000
```

That's it! The system will:

- Initialize PostgreSQL with PostGIS and pgvector extensions
- Set up MinIO for object storage
- Start Redis for task queuing
- Launch the SvelteKit web application
- Spin up Celery workers for background processing

### Next Steps

- **Configure data sources**: Visit Settings ‚Üí Sources in the web UI
- **iOS app**: Build from `apps/ios/` and point to `http://YOUR_IP:3000`
- **Mac agent**: Get token from web UI, run `ariata-mac init TOKEN`
- **Remote access (5G/anywhere)**: See [TAILSCALE_DEPLOY.md](./TAILSCALE_DEPLOY.md)

## üì¶ Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose (v2.0+)
- 8GB RAM minimum, 16GB recommended
- 20GB free disk space

## üîê Database Access

Ariata provides direct PostgreSQL access for power users. Connect with any SQL client, Jupyter notebooks, or your favorite programming language.

### Managing Database Users

Navigate to `/settings/database` in your Ariata web UI to:

- Create read-only users for safe data analysis
- Create read-write users for custom integrations
- Generate secure connection strings

### Example Queries

```sql
-- Recent heart rate data
SELECT timestamp, heart_rate
FROM stream_ios_healthkit
WHERE heart_rate IS NOT NULL
AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- Location history
SELECT timestamp, longitude as lon, latitude as lat
FROM stream_ios_location
WHERE timestamp::date = CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY timestamp;

-- Daily step summary
SELECT 
  DATE(timestamp) as day,
  SUM(steps) as total_steps,
  AVG(heart_rate) as avg_heart_rate
FROM stream_ios_healthkit
GROUP BY DATE(timestamp)
ORDER BY day DESC;
```

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Details

### ELT Data Pipeline

Ariata uses an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) architecture to preserve raw data while enabling flexible analysis:

1. **Extract**: Pull raw data from APIs and devices
2. **Load**: Store in MinIO and PostgreSQL with full fidelity
3. **Transform**: Process and aggregate data for analysis

This approach ensures you never lose data and can reprocess with improved algorithms later.

### Processing Modes

- **Real-time**: Continuous processing for immediate insights
- **Batch**: Nightly consolidation for pattern discovery
- **On-demand**: Query-time transformations for flexibility

### Tech Stack

**Backend**: Python, Celery, FastAPI, PostgreSQL (PostGIS/pgvector), Redis, MinIO

**Frontend**: SvelteKit, TypeScript, TailwindCSS

**Mobile**: Swift/SwiftUI (iOS/macOS)

**ML/AI**: PELT change detection, HDBSCAN clustering, Vector embeddings
